		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		<p>An open optimization problem of how to awaken a set of “asleep” robots, by having an awakened robot move to their locations and activating them.</br> The problem starts with a single awakened robot, but as more and more robots become awakened, they are able to assist in activating other robots as well which leads to a cascading effect. The overall objective of the problem is to minimize the time it takes for the final robot to activate.</p>
